# v1.9.2.0

## New features: 

  1. add `fixdeps` argument for `Fun1D/Fun2D/Fun3D` objects to fix missiing dependencies (or, to add some fictive depebndencies) 
  1. reenable `linalgt` test with `numpy` objects 
  1. add one more test into `linalgt`  
  1. add methos `kullback_leibler` and `asymmetric_kullback_leibkler` into namespace `Ostap::Math`
  1. add method `kullback` to `FitResult`
  1. extend linalg2/t modules 
  1. more polishing of the linear algebra 
  1. extend tests for Linear Algebra operations 
  1. make `styles` to be the class property instead of the class methdod for class `StyleStore`
  1. imporve treatment of the DataFrame/RNode 
  1. more imporve treatment of the DataFrame/RNode 


## Backward incompatible:  

  1. remove `keep`    argument for fun/pdf objects. Hopefully it was never used by the users.  
  1. remove `special` argument for fun/pdf objects. Hopefully it was never used by the users.  

## Bug fixes:

  1. Fix a bit strange problem/feature appearing at 2022/08/11 in dev3 slot: drawing of 
     `Addition` objects with `RooAbsRealLValue` fails.  Fix is done using `FunNop`
  1. fix old typos in `_h3_integrate_` method (thanks to Ivan Polyakov for tproblme report and the fix)  
  1. fix bug  in `MatrixUtilsT.h`
  1. fix typo in `MatrixUtilsT.h`
  1. fix minor bug in `useStyle` 
  1. fix compilation error for gcc12
