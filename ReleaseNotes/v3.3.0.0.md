# v3.3.0.0 

## New features

  1. a bit more correct treatment of the `!` and `!=` in `ROOT.TCut.ast` 
  1. more coherent treatment of the numeric types in `ROOT.TCut`-expressions
  1. some limited treatment of infinity/NaNs in `ROOT.TCut`-expressions
  1. better (more safe) implementaton of `APDF1.check_ranges` method, inclusing better documentation
  1. massive improvement for Apollonius & friends.
  1. add `clamp` method for histograms
  1. `reweight.py` : add check for non-positive data 
  1. extend functionality for checking the uniquness of ROOT/RooFit names (it will reduce amount of code)
  1. allow specificationof explicit suffix for various `rootID/hID/fID/dsID/...` methods 
  1. more improvement for reweighting machinery 
  1. histograms: move calculation of Riemann' sums from python to C++
  1. more harmolization to power-law tails
  1. more haromonization for n/N for Student's t-functions 
  1. more harmonization for some polynomial constructions 
  1. Harmonize polynomizll constructions (both in C++ and python)
  1. Release requirement of the same range for *some* operations with polynomials
  1. Add `HRange/hrange` for histogram-like looping
  1. Tiny improvements in `DataFrame` constructor
  1. Tiny adjustments in (C++) progress-bar(s)
  1. Move `TAxis`-related functions to separate module `ostap/histos/axes.py`
  1. Add more fuctions and operators for `TAxis`, add dedicated test  
  
## Backward  incompatible 

   1. From now `Apollonios` stands for the core asymmetric Apollonios function and `ApolloniosL` represents Aplooniosu functon with power-lay left tail
