# v1.9.9.4

## New features:
   
   1. add context managers for ROOT&RooFit random numbers generators 
   1. slight improvement for `combine.py` : add helper function `covMatrix` to create 100% correlated or uncorrelated covariance matrices
   1. slight improvement for `test_stats_blue.py` 
   1. add `parallel_add_reweighting` to speedup adding the reweighting information to `TTree/TChain`
   1. add parallel version of `sumVar` method 
   1. re-enable TMVA plots 
   1. make parallel fill of datasets more flexible 
   1. add methods `dot` and `weight_sum` to `SVectorWithError`
   1. add parallel versions for jackknife and bootstrapping 
   1. improvements for parallel versions for jackknife and bootstrapping 
   1. make use of [tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate) package - mainly to produce LaTex tables
   1. re-enabvle plots for TMVA 
   1. add `plot` argument to `use_canvas` context manager to print the plot at `__exit__`
   1. fix few typos in documentation 
   1. soem adjustment for `CleanUp` machinery 
   1. improvement for the output for `add_chopping_response` 
   1. do not add `sumw2`/`asymttotic` flags for fitting of `ROOT.RooDataHist` 
   1. allow to deal with the histograms in `make_toys` and `make_toys2` 
   1. add `storage` argument to `PDF.generate` to allow specification of the storage type for dataset 
   1. add `TH1D.eff` and `TH!F.eff` methods to make  "correct" efficinecy historgams 
 
## Backward incompatible: 

## Bug fixes:

   1. Fix the bug/typo  in `padd_reweighting`
   1. fix parallel `addChoppingResponse` - the `categroy_name` was ignored 
   1. fix but in parallel `addChoppingResponse` ( the `category_name` argument was ignored)
