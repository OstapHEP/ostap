# v1.9.9.6

## New features:

  1. add `Ostap::MoreRooFit::ProfileLL` to allow bypass subtraction of the minimum for profile graphs.  From now the profile graph , obtaibed from `PDF.grpah_profile` with option `subtract=False` is not min-subtracted. It is useful e.g, for evalauation of discrete systematic uncertainties using profile-likelihood method  
  1. make attempts to avoid decolorisation of previously createe frames/`RooPlot` objects

## Backward incompatible: 

  1. reparameterise `Bukin2_pdf` in terms of `varsigma` and `asymmetry` instead of `varsig`

## Bug fixes:
