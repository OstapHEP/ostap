# v1.9.1.0

## New features: 

  1. re-enable again `test_fitting_morphing` for new ROOT, 
     see [ROOT/issues/#11061](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11061)
  1. add `MorphingN3_pdf` for morphing in 3 variables 
  1. more owrisk on easy serialization.  Now we can bypass standard serialization fro almost 
     all important Ostap classes.    
  1. make Model2D & Model3D PDFS more safe 
  1. fix `RooGaussian` serialization fo rOLD version of ROOT 
  1. add serialization for `RooFFTConvPdf` instances
  1. add serialization for `RooSimultaneous` instances
  1. make RooCategory more uniform "interface" for RooCategory 
  1. split `variables.py` into `variables.py` and `rooreduce.py` 
  1. add the proper reduction for the effciency objects
  1. add serisalisation for `RooEfficiency` 
  1. add serisalisation for `RooFitResult` (the standard one often gives segfauts)
  1. reduce verbosity for `make_var`
  1. more polishing with verbosity for `make_var`
  1. more polishing for serialisation 
  1. add reduction for Breit-Wigner related PDFs 
  1. improve BWI model and pdf, add dedicated test  

## Backward incompatible:  

## Bug fixes:

  1. couple of (small) fixes in `variables.py` module 
  1. several typos are fixed in construction of 3D-models 
  1. `funbasic` : fix typos 
  1. fix the treatment of shifts in `Convolution`
