Nowadays [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch/) and [PyROOT](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/pyroot) are de-facto standard tools for performing physics analysis. The Ostap project is a community-driven initiative aiming to provide more user friendly and more intuitive interface to [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch/) and [PyROOT](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/pyroot) and extending the existing functionality.

Project started in 2009 from the private collections of python functions used in [Kali](http://inspirehep.net/record/1111459) - framework for calibration of LHCb electromagnetic calorimeter. A lot of functionality is picked from [Bender](http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/bender/) project - python based physics analysis environment used in LHCb experiemnt. Till Autumn 2016 the project was a part of LHCb software suit and with great success has been used for preparation of approximately 60 physics papers. A standalone, LHCb independent version, has appeared at start of 2017

Key features include:

-   Very easy manipulations with [ROOT] and [RooFit] objects: histograms, trees, datasets, etc
-   Very easy interface to [RooFit] machinery
-   Extended set of `models.PDFs` for [RooFit]
-   Powerful, pickle-based persistency for object
-   Interactive `ostap` analysis environment


Dependencies
------------
- _mandatory_: [ROOT] version `<6.22` or `>=6.24`, [RooFit]
- _highly desirable_: [numpy]
   - mandatory for Fast Fourier Transform, used in histogram/function parameterization;
   - optional for some other issues, in particular for the prime number treatment;  
- _optional_: [scipy]
   - numerical integration (quadratures, cubatures), root finding, minimization; 
   - `ostap` offers home-made replacements, but the native methods from `scipy` are more efficient;
- _optional_: [pathos], [dill], [multiprocess] and [ppt]
   - needed for parallel processing; 
   - `ostap` offers a [multiprocessing]-based replacement with reduced functionality; 
- _optional_: [terminaltables]
   - nice format of tables 
         - in particular for nice printout for `TTree`, `TChain`, `RooDataSet`, ... ;
   - `ostap` offers a home-made replacement with a bit reduced functionalty.  
- _desirable_: [more_itertoos]
   - `chunked` stuff is used in parallelization for spliting jobs into chunks 
   - `ostap` offers a home-made replacement  
- _optional_ (only for python3,  `3.6<=version` ) : [berkeleydb]
   - python interface to Berkeley DB (`libdb` needs to be installed!)
- _optional_ (only for python3,  `3.3<=version<3.10` ) : [bsddb3]
   - python interface to Berkeley DB (`libdb` needs to be installed!)
   
Setup
-----

There are several possibilities to start working with Ostap, you can build Ostap on the Linux or lxplus/7, run the docker container and now the Ostap is available on conda and SWAN.
